# react-simple-network-graph

This package contains React components that allow you to create network graphs.
It exports two components:

- `<Network />`, which will render a static network graph; and
- `<DynamicNetwork />`, which will render a dynamic graph, with draggable vertices and a numerical simulation that adjusts the vertex positions until an optimised edge length is obtained.
