# Introduction

This package contains React components that render network graphs.
It exports two components:

- `<NetworkGraph />`, which will render a static network graph; and
- `<DynamicNetworkGraph />`, which will render a dynamic graph, with draggable vertices and a numerical simulation that adjusts the vertex positions until an optimised edge length is obtained.

<Canvas of={DynamicNetworkGraphStories.Māhutonga} />

The package is not optimised for the display of huge networks.
However, its has minimal dependencies (just React, @babel/runtime and prop-types) and is very lightweight.
Both the visual display of the graphs and the movement of the dynamic graph can be customised.

## Examples

For more examples see the documentation of the [NetworkGraph](../?path=/docs/examples-networkgraph--docs) and the [DynamicNetworkGraph](../?path=/docs/examples-dynamicnetworkgraph--docs) components.

## Installation

The components exported by this package are [React](https://react.dev/) components.
You can use them within your existing React app or [create a new one](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).

Once you have created your React app install the react-svg-stars package:

```
npm install react-simple-network-graph
```

or

```
yarn install react-simple-network-graph
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can import and use the `NetworkGraph` or `DynamicNetworkGraph` component within your app:

```
import { DynamicNetworkGraph } from 'react-simple-network-graph';

...

<DynamicNetworkGraph
    vertices={[
      { id: "Gacrux", label: "Gacrux", fill: "yellow", position: { cx: 200, cy: 100 }, },
      { id: "Mimosa", label: "Mimosa", fill: "white", position: { cx: 100, cy: 150 }, },
      { id: "Acrux", label: "Acrux", fill: "white", position: { cx: 200, cy: 250 }, },
      { id: "Imai", label: "Imai", fill: "white", position: { cx: 300, cy: 125 }, },
      { id: "Ginan", label: "Ginan", fill: "lightblue", position: { cx: 240, cy: 250 }, },
    ]}
    edges={[
      { id: "GacruxAcrux", source: "Gacrux", target: "Acrux", length: 300 },
      { id: "MimosaImai", source: "Mimosa", target: "Imai", length: 200 },
    ]}
    />

...
```
